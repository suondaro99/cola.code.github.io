            <p>You're just too good to be true
                Can't take my eyes off of you
                You'd be like heaven to touch
                Oh, I want to hold you so much
                At long last love has arrived
                And I thank God I'm alive
                You're just too good to be true
                I can't take my eyes off of you
                Pardon the way that I stare
                There's nothin' else to compare
                The thought of you leaves me weak
                There're no words left to speak
                But if you feel like I feel
                Please, let me know that it's real
                You're just too good to be true
                Can't take my eyes off of you
                I love you baby
                And if it's quite all right
                I need you baby
                To warm a lonely night
                I love you baby
                Trust in me when I say
                Oh, pretty baby
                Don't bring me down, I pray
                Oh, pretty baby
                Now that I found you, stay
                And let me love you, baby
                Let me love you
                You're just too good to be true
                Can't take my eyes off of you
                You'd be like heaven to touch
                Oh, I want to hold you so much
                At long last love has arrived
                And I thank God I'm alive
                You're just too good to be true
                Can't take my eyes off of you
                I love you baby
                And if it's quite all right
                I need you baby
                To warm a lonely night
                I love you baby
                Trust in me when I say
                Oh, pretty baby
                Don't bring me down, I pray
                Oh, pretty baby
                Now that I found you, stay
                And let me love you, baby
                Let me love you</p>
